        <h2>Understanding Competition</h2>

        <h4>What are competitors doing right?</h4>
        <p>I have noticed that competitors of mine provide a good design flow for how they present their images, and are able to keep people invested
            through use of animations, and other design elements.
        </p>

        <h4>What are competitors doing wrong?</h4>
        <p>The competitors that I have noticed have all taken a lack of creativity when it comes to aspects of their website. They are supposed to make
            it their own, as they are all artists, or artist based, but they just all look the same.
        </p>

        <h4>How can I do it better?</h4>
        <p>I think by making my website more visually distinct, and creative from other websites, while also keeping it professional, I will be able to
            keep a leg up o my competition.
