        <h2>Understanding my Audience</h2>

        <h4>Location</h4>
        <p>I would imagine that someone who is interested in seeing my website would come from anywhere, but to be realistic, 
            they would likely come from an English speaking region like the US, Canada, etc... 
        </p>

        <h4>Age</h4>
        <p>My website will be completely family friendly, meaning that it will be open to all ages that would like to see it,
            however, it is still a portfollio, so those who are more likely to see it would be people from their late teens to 
            possibly their 30s.
        </p>

        <h4>Gender</h4>
        <p>Gender isn't really a factor to consider. Since the website is about me and my work for professional reasons, any gender
            will be available to see it.
        </p>

        <h4>Other Demographics</h4>
        <p>The people who I would like to see my work the most are people who are interested in hiring me for work. I would like to 
            have a professional piece of work under my belt that proves I am capable of working in the software field, and something
            like this would be a step in the right direction.
